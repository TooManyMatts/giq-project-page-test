This repository contains the official codebase for **G-IQ**, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models on a diverse collection of polyhedra exhibiting rich geometric propertiesâ€”convexity, symmetry, and varying levels of complexity.

Stable Fast 3D is based on [TripoSR](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSR) but introduces several new key techniques. For one, we explicitly optimize our model to produce good meshes without artifacts alongside textures with UV unwrapping. We also delight the color and predict material parameters so the assets can be easily integrated into a game. We achieve all of this while still maintaining the fast inference speeds of TripoSR.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure your environment is:
- Python >= 3.8
- Optional: CUDA or MPS has to be available
- For Windows **(experimental)**: Visual Studio 2022
- Has PyTorch installed according to your platform: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ [Make sure the Pytorch CUDA version matches your system's.]
- Update setuptools by `pip install -U setuptools==69.5.1`
- Install wheel by `pip install wheel`

Then, install the remaining requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
For the gradio demo, an additional `pip install -r requirements-demo.txt` is required.
